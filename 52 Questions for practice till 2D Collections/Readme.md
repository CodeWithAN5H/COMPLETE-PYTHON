If you can do at least 30 out of these 44 without watching any video or solution, your Python logic foundation will be rock-solid.

Would you like me to make a progress tracker sheet (in text or Excel) where you can tick off each question as you solve them?




*** RESPONSE 2: ***

Questions #29 and #40 are directly about 2D collections (a.k.a. lists of lists, or ‚Äúmatrix-style‚Äù data).
But to make your 2D skills sharper, here are a few extra 2D-specific problems (you can add them as an advanced section):

---

üß© BONUS: 2D Collections Practice

(Work with list of lists)

1. Matrix Input & Display
Take input for a 3√ó3 matrix and print it neatly row by row.
(Hint: use nested loops)


2. Sum of All Elements
Find and print the sum of all numbers in a 2D list.


3. Row & Column Sum

5. Diagonal Sum

---

‚úÖ So yeah ‚Äî your current learning list already includes 2D collections, and I just expanded that part so you can practice it properly too.

Would you like me to bundle all the questions (44 main + 8 2D) into a formatted checklist file (like Excel or printable PDF) so you can track progress?




*** RESPONSE 3: (TIPS FOR LOGIC BUILDING) ***

Perfect question ‚Äî this is exactly where most learners either level up or stay stuck.
You don‚Äôt need fancy tutorials ‚Äî just a clear logic-building checklist that you follow every time you solve a problem.

Here‚Äôs the short, no-fluff version üëá


---

üß© Logic Building Checklist (Follow This Every Time)

‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Understand the Problem

‚úÖ Read the question twice.

‚úÖ Ask: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the input, what‚Äôs the output, and what‚Äôs being asked?‚Äù

‚úÖ Example: ‚ÄúGiven a number ‚Üí I must find its factorial.‚Äù


üß† If you can explain the problem in one line ‚Äî you understand it.


---

üßÆ Step 2: Break It Into Smaller Steps

Write down logic in plain English, not code.
Example:

Take input n

Initialize fact = 1

Loop from 1 to n and multiply each value

Print result



üß† If your logic works on paper, it‚Äôll work in Python.


---

üîÅ Step 3: Think in Terms of Loops and Conditions

Ask yourself:

Do I need to repeat something? ‚Üí use for or while

Do I need to check something? ‚Üí use if

Do I need to store multiple values? ‚Üí use list/set


üß† This trains your brain to ‚Äúsee‚Äù which structure fits a problem.


---

üß† Step 4: Dry Run (Mentally or on Paper)

Before running the code:

Trace values line by line.

Imagine what happens for sample input.

Example: For n=5, loop ‚Üí 1√ó2√ó3√ó4√ó5.


üß† You‚Äôll catch 80% of bugs before even running Python.


---

üíª Step 5: Code Slowly, Test Often

Don‚Äôt try to write the full code at once.

Print intermediate values (print() everywhere).

Test small inputs first.


üß† Debugging while writing is easier than fixing at the end.


---

üß† Step 6: After It Works ‚Äî Optimize

Can I make this shorter or cleaner?

Can I replace loops with built-ins like sum(), max(), len()?

Can I write this in one line using list comprehension?


üß† This turns working code into smart code.


---

üîÅ Step 7: Re-Solve Later Without Looking

After 2‚Äì3 days, try solving the same question from memory.
If you can, that means the logic clicked.


---

‚úÖ Summary Checklist

[ ] Understand Input & Output  
[ ] Write logic in English  
[ ] Choose right loop/condition  
[ ] Dry run manually  
[ ] Code step by step  
[ ] Optimize after it works  
[ ] Re-solve later from memory


---

Follow this for every problem, even small ones ‚Äî and your logic will get razor-sharp within weeks.

Would you like me to turn this checklist into a small printable ‚ÄúLogic Builder Sheet‚Äù (so you can tick boxes while solving)?
